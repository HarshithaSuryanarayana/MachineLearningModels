# MachineLearningModels

Implementing Machinelearning models:
    Decision Tree and RandomForest algorithm to analyse the perfomance of the algorithms.
    Based on analysis, RandomForest algorithm is better than decisiontree as it gives good performance compared to DT without tuning parameters at the initial stage itself
